Background Remover Web App

A simple web application to remove the background from images using FastAPI and rembg. The frontend is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the backend is deployed on Koyeb.
(there is currently an issue. I don't know what but it works fine remotely and also the server is running fine . i think it is due to the free Koyeb plan which results in a timeout)
